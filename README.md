# Component drafts for Natives in tech website
### [Netlify Deploy of component preview](https://nativesintech-components.netlify.com/)
### [Natives in Tech org repo](https://github.com/nativesintech/nativesintech.org)
This is based off an awesome Next.js starter-- [Next-Starter-Tailwind](https://github.com/taylorbryant/next-starter-tailwind)   
This is utilizing [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a less opinionated utility-first framework   
This features animated hamburger menus from [react-animated-burgers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-animated-burgers), a really cool package that streamlines burger menu animation from state management
